# Replication & Reproducibility

## Replication

- Focuses on the validity of the science
- "Is this claim true?"
- The ultimate standard for strengthening science evidence
- New investigators, data, analytical methods, laboratories, instruments, etc.
- Particularly important in studies that can impact broad policy or regulatory decisions

## Reproducibility

- Focuses on the validity oth the data analysis
- "Can we trust this analysis?"
- Arguably a minimum standard for any scientific study
- New investigatos, same data, same methods
- Important when replication is imposible

## Background and underlying trends
- Some studies cannor be replicated: no time, no money, Unique/oportunistic
- Technology is increasing data collection throughput; data are more complex and high-dimensional
- Existing databases can be marged to become bigger databases (but data are used off-label)
- Computing power allows more so´´histicated analysis, even on "small" data
- For every field "X" there is a "Computational X"

## The result?
- Even basic analysis are dificult to describe
- Heavy computational requirements are thrust upon people with out adequate training in statistics and computing
- Error are more easily intriduced into long analysis pipelines
- Knowledge transger is inhibited
- Results are difficult to replicate or reproduce
- Complicated analyses cannot be trusted
